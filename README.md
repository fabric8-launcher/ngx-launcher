A collection of Angular services and components to work with [Forge Wizard UI](http://forge.jboss.org/) to provide an easy getting started experience with OpenShift.


You can see how it is used in:
* [fabric8-ui](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-ui) application - deployed https://openshift.io
* [launchpad-frontend](https://github.com/fabric8-launchpad/launchpad-frontend) application - deployed https://launch.openshift.io

All components shared a common object model for the Input.
ForgeService provide common REST endpoints like `next`, `validate`, `execute` to work with your Swarm backends, see:
* [launchpad backend](https://github.com/fabric8-launch/launchpad-backend) and its [launchpad-addon](https://github.com/fabric8-launch/launchpad-addon).
* [fabric8 backend](https://github.com/fabric8io/generator-backend) and its [fabrci8-generator add-on ](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-generator).
